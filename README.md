Minimal reimplementation of [optimBench](https://github.com/IoannisAntonoglou/optimBench), a *Benchmark testbed for assessing the performance of optimisation algorithms
*

Right now it's a direct translation of the original code. Aiming to make it more idiomatic, 
and to improve performance by relying more on Numpy.


## Missing:

- Multivariate functions
- Non-stationarity
- Integration
